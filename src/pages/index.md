## Quick start
We designed Prodigy to get you going quickly. When you are ready to purchase, reach out to [Sales@prodigyems.com](mailto:Sales@prodigyems.com) and we will get your account ready to go.

### Adding Users
The first step is to add your users. You have 3 options to get started: invite all of your users, create each user account, or upload a list of users. Once the accounts are created, users will have immediate access to their new Prodigy account.
{% callout type="warning" title="Invite Users" %}
Our recommended option is to invite users individually to Prodigy. When you choose to invite users, they will receive an email asking them to join your department. If they don’t have an account they will be prompted to create one. If they have an account (even if it’s a different email address) they can connect it to your department.
{% /callout %}
### Assign a Class
The best next step after getting users in the system is assigning a class. The assignment will give users a second email alerting them to their new account, make sure that all users are getting emails, and gets everyone to sign in to their new account.

## Customize Prodigy
Now that you have all the accounts created and everyone is in, you can add some customization. Your team will login and see a great mix of your own material and ours and it will make your training management easier. Don't have time to customize? Don't worry. We include everything you need to make sure your team has what they need to stay compliant and up-to-date with best practices. 

### Add a Class
Use our [class builder](/docs/create-class) to get your custom content in the system. This doesn't need to be a fully created class. Find a great podcast or online video, add a quiz and you have your first custom class. 


### Create a Training Plan
[Training plans](/docs/training-plans) are a great way to organize your training. Whether it's a new employee plan, annual training, or resuscitation training; you can organize your training and issue it out with one click (maybe two).

### Add Custom Certifications
Do you have certifications that you track that aren't in the system? No problem, we can get those added and allow you to track the training and certifications YOU need.
