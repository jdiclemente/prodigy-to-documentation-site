## Using Prodigy for Handtevy
Prodigy will be used for all aspects of the online Handtevy Certified Provider course. The online compenet consists of a 3 hour course with a BLS and ALS version available. The hands-on portion will be tracked through Prodigy where students will receive an additional 2 hours of CAPCE credit. Prodigy features a live registration system which can be used to manage the in person training, or you can use your own system and simply use Prodigy as the record management system.
## Adding Users
There are several ways to add users in to your prodigy account, if you have questions about the best option, we are happy to help get you started.

### Invite users
{%figure src="/images/send-invite.png" caption="Access from Users->Invite New User" atl="User Panel" /%}
Our recommended option is to invite users individually to Prodigy. When you choose to invite users, they will receive an email asking them to join your department. If they don’t have an account they will be prompted to create one. If they have an account (even if it’s a different email address) they can connect it to your department. 

Click Users -> Invite New User. You can paste multiple emails in this box. If you have a list of email addresses, just copy and paste it here and they will all receive a separate invite. Once sent, click on the “Pending Invites” tab to see who hasn’t been accepted yet and send reminders. If you invite a user who is already in your account, they will not receive an invite.

### Add individual users
You can add a user in directly as long as their email address is not already in use. Click on Users -> Add New User. We only require a name, email, and user role to get them started. The user will receive an email with their login credentials. 

### Bulk upload
When we first set your department up, we can bulk upload all of your users. A form will be sent as part of your on boarding package that can be used for bulk upload. Once uploaded, all new users will get an email with their login credentials. We still prefer inviting users over bulk upload since inviting them allows them to set up an account with an existing Prodigy account.
## Assigning Course
When you create an assignment each user will get an email alerting them of the assignment and letting them know who assigned it and when it is due. It will also add the assignment to their dashboard and to their assignment tabs. To create and manage assignments click the **Assignments** tab.
